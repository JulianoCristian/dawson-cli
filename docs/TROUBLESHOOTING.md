## Troubleshooting

Common error causes:

* syntax error in your code, try to lint or run `babel-node api.js`
* check that all your dependecies are listed in `package.json`
* make sure you have run `npm install`
* permissions on your files are too strict (sorry), see [issue #1](https://github.com/lusentis/dawson/issues/1)
* search or open an issue
